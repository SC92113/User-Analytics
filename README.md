### My 'Out of PM scopes' data project 

### Executive Summary
This data insight report provides a comprehensive analysis of the user segments, preferences, and needs related to the usage of our product, Enernet. As a product manager, by leveraging data from user population spreadsheets and qualitative and quantitative user feedback, I aim to improve Enernet to better serve our users. The analysis reveals four primary user segments, with the "Environmental, Safety & Sustainability" segment being the most significant. The report highlights key user pain points, preferred features, and useful data types, offering insights to guide product enhancements.
